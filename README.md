# Viva Connection Bot Powered Adaptive Card Extensions (ACEs) sample repository

Repository for the Viva Connections Bot Powered Adaptive Cards (ACEs) sample solutions from Microsoft and community. Bot Powered Adaptive Card Extensions (ACEs) for Microsoft Viva Connections are a new technology to extend the Microsoft Viva Connections Dashboard leveraging the [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/index-bf-sdk?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) development model. This repository contains community samples that demonstrate different usage patterns for the Bot Powered ACEs.

> We do welcome community contributions to the samples folder in this repository for demonstrating different use cases with SharePoint Framework. Notice that if you use 3rd party libraries, please make sure that library license allows distributions of it as part of your sample.

Viva Connections Adaptive Card Extensions are cards that can be exposed through the Viva Connections Desktop or Mobile experiences.
